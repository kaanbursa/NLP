# Topic Modeling with SVD and NMF

### Singular Value Decomposition

SVD is Matrix Factorization technique used in Topic Modeling for reducing the dimensions of the matrix which represents (Document & Terms). The idea behind SVD is finding words which occur frequently in one topic and does not occur another topic which will give us document specific important words revealing the topic.

The matrix is Document in rows and the vocabulary as columns and occurence value as interseption.

SVD is an exact decomposition meaning that multipling back the matrices again will return the original matrix.

A = U * S * V.T

### Non-Negative Matrix Factorization

>"Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) has become a widely used tool for the analysis of high dimensional data as it automatically extracts sparse and meaningful features from a set of nonnegative data vectors."

NMF approximates a matrix X with low-rank matrix approximation such that X approx. W *H. Where the properties does not have values below 0 which makes it Non-Negative

Also NMF is a non-exact decomposition where if you want to generate original matrix there is an reconstruction error.

Both techniques extract meaningful words related to the document for person to understand the topic of the document
